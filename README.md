# Stock Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`StockPredictLSTM3.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices. It includes detailed steps ranging from data preprocessing and model building to making predictions with real stock data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Main programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for running the notebook.
- **TensorFlow**: For building LSTM models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- All Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `StockPredictLSTM3.ipynb` from the Jupyter Notebook UI.
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the model in action.
